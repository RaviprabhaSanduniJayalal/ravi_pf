    bio: `I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Ruhuna, passionate about software engineering and full-stack development. My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how digital solutions can solve real-world problems.
  
  Currently focusing on expanding my knowledge in modern web technologies, I enjoy building interactive and user-friendly applications. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of frontend design and backend functionality.
  
  My goal is to secure a Software Engineering or Full-Stack internship where I can apply my skills, learn from industry professionals, and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.`,
